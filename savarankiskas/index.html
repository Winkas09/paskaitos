      <p>
        <strong>The Maine coon </strong> is the <em>largest</em> domestic cat
        breed, and largeness is certainly one of its defining physical
        characteristics. The size of a typical Maine coon comes in at 10–16
        inches tall and up to an impressive 40 inches in length. These sturdily
        built felines usually weigh 8–18 pounds and have muscular bodies with
        wide chests and solid legs. As if their big-boned build wasn't enough,
        the ample fur in the Maine coon's coat makes these majestic animals look
        even bigger. Their long coat is silky and smooth and grows shorter near
        the shoulders. Maine coons come in a variety of colors and patterns. You
        can find solid white, cream, red, blue, and black Maine coons, as well
        as tabby, bi-color, parti-color, tortoiseshell, shaded, and calico Maine
        coons. Other defining physical features are large pointed ears often
        topped with wisps of hair, expressive oval-shaped eyes, and a long,
        bushy tail.

        <h2>Temperament</h2>
        <p>
          Don't let their imposing size fool you—deep down, Maine coons are
          soft, gentle giants who love to spend time with their humans. They
          expect to be part of the family and aren't big on personal space or
          privacy. These cats are delighted at the thought of following you from
          room to room as you go about your day. Though Maine coon's are
          affectionate and social, they're not usually lap cats. This breed
          typically prefers to hang out beside you rather than on top of
          you—which can be a good thing, considering their size. Maine coons are
          incredibly intelligent, fun-loving, and will keep their kittenish
          playfulness well into old age. The Maine Coon Cat Club calls them the
          "clowns of the cat world." They're not an aggressive breed and will
          tolerate being picked up, held, and cuddled. Maine coons are friendly,
          kind, and patient with children.

        <h2>Living Needs</h2>
        <p>
          The Maine coon's first and foremost need is an affectionate, loving
          family with the time to play and willingness to include this cat in
          all aspects of day-to-day life. These patient pets are good with kids,
          dogs, and other cats. Maine coons can be left alone for periods of
          time, but they won't be happy about it. Regularly being left alone can
          make these cats sad and anxious, so they're best matched with a family
          that often has at least one or two people home during the day for some
          company. Most Maine coons love to play in the water. This is great
          news for bath time, but it also means they'll follow you into the
          shower or try to interfere while you do the dishes. These big cats are
          surprisingly quiet—they do love to communicate and vocalize to their
          humans, but their soft voice may take you by surprise. Maine coons are
          amazing family pets. Those with the time, patience, and attention to
          give to a member of this cat breed will be hard-pressed to find a more
          loving, adoring feline friend.

        <h2>Care</h2>
        <p>
          "Maine coons have a heavy, shaggy coat which requires maintenance
          brushing to ensure it doesn't get tangled or matted," says Catherine
          Lenox, DVM, DACVN, a board-certified veterinary nutritionist with
          Royal Canin. Your Maine coon will need regular, dedicated grooming and
          will require anywhere from weekly to monthly bathing. Their long coats
          are usually silky smooth, but when they start to look greasy or
          stringy, it's time for a bath. They also require weekly brushing to
          keep their long hair and undercoat from getting tangled and matted.
          These cats do shed quite a bit, and regular brushing will help get rid
          of loose hairs. Don't worry—the Maine coon loves any sort of attention
          it can get, so grooming is usually a pleasant task. Maine coons don't
          have any special exercise needs—they'll keep the same activity
          schedule as most cats, with long hours of sleep and playful bouts of
          jumping and running through the house. Cat toys and cat trees can help
          them work out some of that energy. These super-intelligent cats are
          easily trainable. Some owners have described the Maine coon as
          "dog-like" for their ability to be trained—they can learn to walk on a
          leash outdoors or even play a round of fetch. They take quickly to
          basic house training and litter box use, but keep in mind these large
          cats will require a large litter box to help them comfortably do their
          business. Maine coons should be socialized early on. If you're
          bringing home a Maine coon kitten as a family pet, be sure to let the
          various members of the household—small kids included—gently handle the
          kitten daily. They should also be introduced to other pets if
          possible. These early introductions will keep your cat from becoming
          shy and reserved. Feed your Maine coon high-quality cat food and
          monitor their diet to prevent them from overeating. Check in with your
          vet to learn how much and how often to feed your individual cat to
          meet their specific needs.

        <h2>Health</h2>
        <p>
          <u
            >Maine coons have a lifespan of 10–13 years and are typically
            healthy pets.</u
          >
          But, as with all breeds, there are some health issues to be aware of.
          Lenox says Maine coons are predisposed to the following conditions:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Joint diseases, including arthritis and hip dysplasia</li>
          <li>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)</li>
          <li>Dental disease</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Reputable breeders will screen for health issues in your kitten, but
          it's important to have them screened regularly into adulthood. HCM and
          other health problems can go undetected until later in your cat's
          life.
